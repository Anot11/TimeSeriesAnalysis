# TimeSeriesAnalysis

A collection of assessments in Time Series Analysis completed as part of my Econometrics program. I intend this particular repository to focus on Forecasting Models in Python.
I have used Google's Cloud-based Colaboratory Jupyter IDE for the purposes of this repository.


Topics covered in this repository include but are not limited to:

1. Regression Models
2. Moving Average(MA) Models
3. Autoregressive (AR) Models
4. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models
5. Stationarity, Seasonality, Unit Root Tests
6. Forecasting in the above models with Seasonal Variations, Business Cycle Variations, Trends, Volatility etc.
7. Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) Models
8. Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) Models
9. Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models
10. Cointegeration and Spurious Regressions



Comments, suggestions always welcome.
